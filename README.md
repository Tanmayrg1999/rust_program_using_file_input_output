# rust_program_using_file_input_output
## HOW TO EXECTUTE THE CODE
You need to copy all the above code files in the same directory in my case it is the "C:/Users/tanma/CLionProjects/untitled/src". After copying all the files successfully enter the input in the "user_ip_file.txt" file and keep the file parameteres separted by " , " and let the 4th parameter be the currency in numerics.
Then run the code and the "user_op_file.txt" will succesfully be appended by the data and the resulting textual currency output.
